# Bare Bones

A bare-bones example of the [Graph](/graph/Graph) component.

It may be used this way if, for instance, a force-directed layout computes the related geometry. Otherwise, these are uncommon:

- Both the `width` and `height` properties are provided.
- Connection terminals are _points_ rather than _ids_.

See [the next demo](/demos/some-flesh) for a more common usage.

## Render

<Graph />

## Source

<Code code={code} />
